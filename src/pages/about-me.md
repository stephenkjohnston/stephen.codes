# Howdy, I'm Stephen ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for building efficient, user-friendly applications and diving deep into emerging technologies. I thrive at the intersection of code, creativity, and problem-solving, with a particular interest in front-end development, and a passion for COBOL. 

I'm driven by a commitment to continuous learning, a belief in the power of well-structured documentation, and a desire to create solutions that make a meaningful impact.

When I'm not coding or tinkering with new tools, you might find me enjoying a good meme, reflecting on the importance of foundational principles, or spending quality time with my familyâ€”often with a healthy dose of laughter and love.

## Get in Touch
I'm always open to connecting, whether it's about a potential project, a shared interest, or just to chat about the latest tech trends. The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:stephenjohnston@protonmail.com).
