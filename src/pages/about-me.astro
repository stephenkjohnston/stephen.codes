  <h1>Howdy, I'm Stephen ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a software developer with a passion for building efficient,
    user-friendly applications and diving deep into emerging technologies. I
    thrive at the intersection of code, creativity, and problem-solving, with a
    particular interest in front-end development, and a passion for COBOL.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm driven by a commitment to continuous learning, a belief in the power of
    well-structured documentation, and a desire to create solutions that make a
    meaningful impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding or tinkering with new tools, you might find me enjoying
    a good meme, reflecting on the importance of foundational principles, or
    spending quality time with my familyâ€”often with a healthy dose of laughter
    and love.
  </p>

  <h2>Get in Touch</h2>

    shared interest, or just to chat about the latest tech trends. The best way
