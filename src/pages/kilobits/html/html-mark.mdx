Ever have something to say that's so important you want it to jump off the page? Fortunately, <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> comes with a convenient yellow highlighter... seriously... it's yellow. The `<mark>` tag is used to visually draw attention to a piece of text.

## How to use the `<mark>` tag
To use this, simply wrap the content you want highlighted with the `<mark>` tag.

```html
The quick brown fox <mark>jumped</mark> over...
```

When rendered in the browser, the above example looks like this. Notice the word "jumped" is highlighted with yellow.

<LivePreview>
The quick brown fox <mark>jumped</mark> over...
</LivePreview>

## Mark My Words: When to Use `<mark>`
Great! Now that you know about HTML's highlighter and how to use it, **when should you reach for the `<mark>` tag**?

* **Highlighting search terms** in search results.
* **Drawing attention to key points** in documentation or tutorials.
* **Marking up important content** in user-generated text (e.g., comments or reviews).

## What About Other Attention-Grabbing Tags?
While the `<mark>` tag is great for highlighting important text, it's not the only option for grabbing attention. In fact, there are the `<b>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags too.

## When to use other attention-grabbing tags?
Here's a quick guide to help you decide which tag to use, and when:

* The `<b>` tag simply bolds text for **stylistic emphasis** -- no extra meaning here. It's just for looks and has no impact on screen readers.
* The `<strong>` tag shouts, "Hey, look at me, I'm super important!" -- TL;DR: **It's bold for a reason**. Plus, screen readers emphasize it, so it's perfect for accessibility!
* The `<em>` tag displays Italic text for **emphasis or tone**.
