## Why Use CSS-Only Tooltips?
Modern websites are typically stuffed with heavy slabs of JavaScript, CSS, and yeah, even pointless, tangled, nested HTML elements—I'm glaring at you, drag-and-drop editors! All that junk slows your site to a crawl, and nobody's got time for that. Ditching extra libraries keeps things fast and lean, so you're not piling on more digital deadweight.

In this article, we'll show you how to make tooltips—those handy little popups—without touching JavaScript. We'll use [custom data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), to stash the tooltip text in HTML, then grab it with CSS's  [attr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) to display it on hover (or tap). No JavaScript, just pure CSS magic.
