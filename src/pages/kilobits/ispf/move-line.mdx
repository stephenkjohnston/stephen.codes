## The Move Line Command?
The `M` (move) line command is used with the `B` (before) or `A` (after) line commands. Unlike the [copy](/kilobits/ispf/copy-line) command, which leaves the original in place, move does a <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, and places it somewhere else. Move a single line using `M`, or multiple lines using `MM` (block). Note, that if you get <kbd>ENTER</kbd> happy, and forget to specifiy where you want to copy the line to, a `MOVE/COPY pending` message at the top right of your screen. If you see this message, you can either type `B` or `A` in the prefix area of the line you want to move your data to, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to complete the action.

### What we'll be working with
Like with our copy example, let's say we have a list of tasks. Now, I don't know if you're a fortunate person who never has to rearrage your tasks, but I'm not! So, let's look at how we can re-arrange our chaotic days.

```
000100 TODO: DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL
000200 TODO: GO GROCERY SHOPPING
000300 TODO: GO TO THE GYM
000400 TODO: PLAY LOTS OF DOOM
000500 TODO: TAKE A NAP
000600 TODO: PICK KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL
```
So, you can see we have a lot of to do, and I see one task that needs to be removed. Who has time for a nap? Why not check out how to remove that item using the [delete line command](/kilobits/ispf/delete-line) instead? 

```
000100 TODO: DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL
000200 TODO: GO GROCERY SHOPPING
000300 TODO: GO TO THE GYM
000400 TODO: PLAY LOTS OF DOOM
000500 TODO: PICK KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL
```

There, that's more realistic! Sp, let's say we want to move the `GO GROCERY SHOPPING` task to the end of the list. We can do that with the `M` and `A` line commands.

### How to Move One or More Lines
1. First, type `M` in the prefix area of the `GO GROCERY SHOPPING` todo (e.g., 000100). Remember that if you needed to move 2 todo's, we could type a number after the `C` (e.g., `C2`). 
2. I see you! Don't press <kbd>Enter</kbd> yet!
3. Next, type `A` (for after) in the prefix area of last line (e.g., 000500). Remember, if you also use `B` (for before) to move it above.
4. Finally, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command.

This will pick the first line and move it the last task in the list, which moves the gym task up, resulting in:

```
000100 TODO: DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL 
000300 TODO: GO TO THE GYM       
000400 TODO: PLAY LOTS OF DOOM       
000500 TODO: PICK KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL
000600 TODO: GO GROCERY SHOPPING     
```

### How to Move a Block of Lines
Using the same todo list, let's say we want to move the `GO TO THE GYM` and `PLAY LOTS OF DOOM` tasks to the end of the list. We can do that with the `MM` and `A` line commands.

```
000100 TODO: DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL 
000300 TODO: GO TO THE GYM       
000400 TODO: PLAY LOTS OF DOOM       
000500 TODO: PICK KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL
000600 TODO: GO GROCERY SHOPPING   <-- moved here -->
```

1. First, type `MM` in the prefix area of first tasks we want to move (e.g., 000300).
2. Next, type `MM` in the prefix area of last one (e.g., 000400).
3. Then, type `A` (for after) in the prefix area of the last task (e.g., 000600).
3. Now you can press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

This will copy the comment block to the new location, resulting in:

```
000100 TODO: DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL 
000400 TODO: PICK KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL
000500 TODO: GO GROCERY SHOPPING     
000600 TODO: GO TO THE GYM           <-- moved here -->
000700 TODO: PLAY LOTS OF DOOM       <-- moved here-->
```

## Summary
In this [#kilobit](/kilobits), you learned how to move one or more lines in the ISPF editor using the `MOVE` line command. Until next time, may the code be with you.
