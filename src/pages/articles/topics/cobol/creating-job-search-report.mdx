## Overview
In Washington State, when you're unemployed, you are required to maintain a [job search log](https://esd.wa.gov/media/pdf/1045/esd-job-search-logpdf/download?inline). Periodically, you'll meet with a representative and provide them with the searches you've done within the last two weeks. Since I store my logs in Excel, I can export this data quickly. However, because I love COBOL and need more practice writing reports, I decided to create a Job Search Log Report using GnuCOBOL. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to show how I approach writing a program in COBOL.

## The Data
Having created several reports on the mainframe—thanks to my pre-apprenticeship with [EMMA](https://emma.foundation)—I had a basic idea of how I wanted to structure my data. After doing a little normalization, here’s what I ended up with:

| Field | Size | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Week Ending         | 8 bytes  | *Numeric*      |
| Contact Date        | 8 bytes  | *Numeric*      |
| Employer            | 47 bytes | *Alphanumeric* |
| Job Title           | 77 bytes | *Alphanumeric* |
| Contact Method      | 1 byte   | *Numeric*      |
| Contact Type        | 1 byte   | *Numeric*      |
| WorkSource Activity | 1 byte   | *Numeric*      |

### Understanding the Data
Now that 

**Note**: For this sample, I have condensed the data for easier viewing.
